Due:   Thursday, January   30 at   11:59 pm   on   Gradescope

Complete   the   following   problems   worth   35   total   points.      You   must   show   all   work   and   include   justifications   to   receive   full   credit.      When   submitting   your   work   on   Gradescope,   please   double   check   that   your   scans/images   are   clear   and   that   you   matched   each   problem   with   the   correct   page(s)   of your work when prompted.
1.    (4   points)   To   show   that   the   set   A   of   odd   numbers   is   countable,   we   considered   in   class   the function   f   : N →   A   such   that   f   (k) = 2k − 1.   Prove   that   f   is   a   bijection.
2.    (4 points) To   show   that   the   set   of   integers   Z   is   countable, we   considered   in   class   the   function f   : N → Z   such   that
   
Prove that f   is a bijection.
3.      (5 points)Definition.   Let   Λ be   a   nonempty   set   and   suppose   that   for   each   α   ∈   Λ,   there   is   a   correspond-   ing   set   Aα   .   The   family   of   sets   {Aα    |   α   ∈   Λ} is   called   an   indexed   family   of   sets   indexed   by Λ   .   Each   α   ∈   Λ is   called   an   index   and   Λ is   called   an   indexing   set.
Let   Λ   be   a   nonempty   subset   of   N.    Let      {Aα   }α   ∈Λ    be   an   indexed   family   of   countable   sets.   Prove   that   ∪α   ∈ΛAα   is   a   countable   set.(Hint:   Since   each   Aα   is   countable, there   is   an   injection   gα    :   Aα    → N.   Define   f   : ∪α   ∈ΛAα    →   N×Nby   f(x)   = (gα0   (x),   α0), where   α0   is   the   smallest   natural   number   of   Λ such   that   x   ∈   Aα0 .   Show that f   is injective).
4.    (4 points) Let   a,   b,   candd   be   any   real   numbers   such   that   a   < band   c   < d.    Show   that   [a,   b]   and   [c.d] have   the   same   cardinality.
5.    (4 points) Show   that   (0,   1] a代 写Math 3100/5100 - Written Homework 3R

6.    (4   points)   Let   P   and   Q   be   infinite   sets.      Prove   that   iff      :   Q   → P   is   a   bijection   then      Q   is uncountable if and only ifP is uncountable.   Do not use proof   by contradiction.
7.    Recall   that   a   sequence   a   = {ak}∞k=1 of numbers is an infinite list
a =   (a1   ,   a2   ,   a3,   a4   ,   ...)
where each element akis a number.   Let   S   be the   set of sequences   whose   elements   are   either
0 or   1, in   other   words,



For example, the following sequences are elements   of the set   S:a =   (0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   ...)   ∈ Sb =   (0, 1,   0, 1,   0, 1,   ...) ∈ Sc =   (0,   0, 1, 1,   0,   0,   ...) ∈ Sd   =   (1, 1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   ...) ∈ S
(a) (3 points) Give   two   non-trivial   examples   of   functions   from   N   to   S.   (b) (4 points) Consider   the   function   f      : S → P(N) defined   as
f (a) = {k   ∈ N |   ak   =   1}
where   P(N) is   the   power   set   of   N.   Hence,f   takes   a   sequence   a   ∈   S   and   outputs   the   indices where   a   is   equal   to   1.   For   example:
f (0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   ...) = 0/
f (1,   0,   1,   0,   1,   0,   1,   0,   ...) = {1,   3,   5,   7,   ...}
f (0,   0,   1,   1,   0,   0,   0,   0,   ...) = {3,   4}
f (1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   1,   ...) = {1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   ....}   = N
Prove   that   f   : S → N   is   a   bijection.
(c)   (3   points)   Combine   part   (b),   Problem   6   and   Cantor’s   theorem   to   thoroughly   explain whether S is countable or uncountable.
8.    (BONUS,   5   points)   Prove   the   following   generalization   of   the   result   of   Problem   3:    if   Λ   is a   countable   set,   and   {Aα   }α   ∈Λ    is   an   indexed   family   of   countable   sets,   then   ∪α   ∈ΛAα    is   a countable   set.
